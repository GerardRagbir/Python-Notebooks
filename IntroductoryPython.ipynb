        "> Python uses a means of execution by running through each line of code and executing them all on the fly. If it finds an error on one particular line, it will show a message about the type of error and approximately where it occured.\n",

Some words in Python cannot be used to create a variable since these may be reserved for some other purpose by the language. All variable names are case sensitive, and cannot start with a digit. There are two types of variables: global and local, however we won't really be concerned with those in this notebook. Check out [this article](https://learnpython.com/blog/getting-started-with-python-data-types/) if you want to learn more about variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "* <b>Functions:</b> \n",
        "> Sometimes we end up writing the exact same code a number of times. This is considered not ideal, and falls in line with the [DRY principle](https://thevaluable.dev/dry-principle-cost-benefit-example/): <u>D</u>on't <u>R</u>epeat <u>Y</u>ourself. Functions essentially help us reuse the same set of code to repeatedly accomplish an action, and are important to help divide complex code blocks into simpler or smaller parts. Python also has many useful built in functions. Later in the notebook, there's a section on using and creating your own functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "* <b>Classes:</b> \n",
        "> Classes are user-defined blueprints which allow us to create an object. We'll tackle this later on, but think about how many different species of cats exists, yet they are all cats nonetheless. Cats in this case is the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "* <b>Modules:</b> \n",
        "> Modules are external files which contain Python code that we may want to use. Sometimes we may create our own bits of code and find another use for them later on, or share different python files with a team to help better organize a project. Or we may find that someone else has done some fantastic work elsewhere and has shared their code with us. These are all instances where we'd need to access or use modules. In other languages, they may be referred to as libraries or packages.\n",
